# WGCNA analysis, second pass

The anlayses and image was made by following along with and modifing the [first in a series of WGCNA tutorial](https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/Tutorials/Consensus-DataInput.R). The first tutorial focuses on data input, cleaning and pre-processing; outlier removal; clustering of samples by their Euclidean distance; a comparison of sample cluster to sample meta data. 

The second tutorial organized genes into modules

- "../analysis/08_WGCNA_1.R" 
- "../analysis/08_WGCNA_2.R"
