# Characterizing the neurogenomics of parental care in the rock dove

## Overview

This repository contains the data and analysis for a collaboration between Drs. Rebecca Calisi and Matt MacManes that focuses on one characterizing the neurogenomocs of parental care in the rock dove.

## Organization

These repositories is broken down into the following sub-repositories, each with their own unique purpose and structure.

- analysis: where the .Rmd script and the .md outputs live. The prefix corresponds to the order of operation. 
- figures: where figure generated by the scripts live. The prefix correspond to the script prefix that created the files
- metadata: contains files that describe the sample variables and a rosseta stone for transcripts to gene ids. 
- results: where data generated by the scripts live. The prefix correspond to the script prefix that created the files

There are two hidden directories, `kallisto_mappings` and `mapping`, which contain the results of the kallisto and salmon algorithms that transform read counts into gene counts.

See also <https://macmanes-lab.github.io/DoveParentsRNAseq/> for a more user-friendly way to read the information on the poster. The bulk of the analysis for the SBN poster were created using the script [analysis/04_DESeq2_sexes.Rmd](https://github.com/macmanes-lab/DoveParentsRNAseq/blob/master/analysis/04_DESeq2_sexes.Rmd), which really needs a different name.
