*Needs to be replaced with a better PCA plot showing all samples as
points*

Discussion
----------

-   What genes differ in expression between timepoints?
-   What stages are most different, stressful, responsive?
-   How do genes in the HPG affect genes in other regions?
-   How do male and females differ?
-   How do tissues differ?
-   What is the relationship between genes and hormones across
    timepoints?
