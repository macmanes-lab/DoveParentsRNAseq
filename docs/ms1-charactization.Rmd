## Introduction


## Methods

## Results

## Fig 2: Prolactin fluctuates the most and peaks near hatch in males and females

## Figure 3: General RNAseq pattern, tissue > sex > parental stage

_Needs to be replaced with a better PCA plot showing all samples as points_

## Figure 4: model showing ability to predict non-parental, egg care, and nestling care

## Figure 5: PRL gene expression in the pituitary in prolactin mirrors PRL in blood

## Figure 6: Many genes mirror the PRL expression pattern

## Discussion 

- What genes differ in expression between timepoints?
- What stages are most different, stressful, responsive?
- How do genes in the HPG affect genes in other regions?
- How do male and females differ?
- How do tissues differ?
- What is the relationship between genes and hormones across timepoints?
