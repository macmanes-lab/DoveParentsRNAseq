## Introduction

- What genes differ in expression between timepoints?
- What stages are most different, stressful, responsive?
- How do genes in the HPG affect genes in other regions?
- How do male and females differ?
- How do tissues differ?
- What is the relationship between genes and hormones across timepoints?
