abstract = {Ring doves with increased plasma prolactin and low plasma LH (Group A) or with low plasma prolactin and low plasma LH (Group B) which had been incubating sterile eggs for 12 or 18 days, respectively, had their nests and eggs removed for 3 days. Upon nest return, observations were made on the birds' readiness to renest and on changes in plasma prolactin and LH. Birds from Group A demonstrated a far greater tendency to resume incubation than birds from Group B. Nest deprivation resulted in a sharp fall in the concentration of plasma prolactin in birds which were deprived of their nests after 12 days of incubation (Group A). Following resumption of incubation no subsequent increase in the prolactin levels was observed in Group A or B. The concentration of plasma LH rose sharply after nest deprivation in both sexes of both groups and declined after return of the nests. Birds in Groups A and B which returned to their nests laid a new clutch of eggs while continuing to incubate. The total length of uninterrupted sitting following nest return was 20.9 ± 0.48 days (n = 8). These results suggest that (1) once the mechanism responsible for the increase in plasma prolactin during incubation is disrupted, it cannot be reactivated unless the whole reproductive cycle is repeated. (2) The inhibition of LH secretion during incubation involves neural mechanisms which do not necessarily involve the anti-gonadotrophic action of prolactin. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza-tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

A large variety of parental behaviors has been described across species and sexes, raising fascinating questions about how animals identify the young and how brain circuits drive and modulate parental displays in males and females. Recent studies have begun to uncover a striking antagonistic interplay between brain systems underlying parental care and infant-directed aggression in both males and females, as well as a large range of intrinsic and environmentally driven neuralmodulation and plasticity. Improved understanding of the neural control of parental interactions in animals should provide novel insights into the complex issue of human parental care in both health and disease.},

Behavioral traits are likely to result from epistatic relationships among genes, and techniques like RNA sequencing (RNAseq) can bring us closer to understanding these systems. RNAseq can reveal all mRNA produced at a specific sampling point, exposing correlations between genes or genetic networks and behavioral phenotypes. This technology is becoming increasingly available to biologists studying nontraditional model organisms and can unearth important species-specific genetic regulators and interactions that may have been previously overlooked with only candidate gene investigations. Initial description of gene expression associated with a given behavior, followed by hypothesis-driven approaches and experimental manipulations, can now provide one of the most in-depth explorations of bidirectional interactions between genes and animal behavior.},

In the avian reproductive model of the rock dove (Columba livia), we characterized the transcript community of each tissue of the HPG axis in both sexes, thereby significantly expanding our mechanistic insight into HPG activity. We report greater sex-biased differential expression in the pituitary as compared to the hypothalamus, with multiple genes more highly expressed in the male pituitary being related to secretory function, and multiple genes more highly expressed in the female pituitary being related to reproduction, growth, and development. We report tissue-specific and sex-biased expression in genes commonly investigated when studying reproduction, highlighting the need for sex parity in future studies. In addition, we uncover new targets of investigation in both sexes, which could potentially change our understanding of HPG function.},

abstract = {Stress is a well-known cause of reproductive dysfunction in many species, including birds, rodents, and humans, though males and females may respond differently. A powerful way to investigate how stress affects reproduction is by examining its effects on a biological system essential for regulating reproduction, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Often this is done by observing how a stressor affects the amount of glucocorticoids, such as cortisol or corticosterone, circulating in the blood and their relationship with a handful of known HPG-producing reproductive hormones, like testosterone and estradiol. Until now, we have lacked a full understanding of how stress affects all genomic activity of the HPG axis and how this might differ between the sexes. We leveraged a highly replicated and sex-balanced experimental approach to test how male and female rock doves (Columba livia) respond to restraint stress at the level of their transcriptome. Females exhibit increased genomic responsiveness to stress at all levels of their HPG axis as compared to males, and these responsive genes are mostly unique to females. Reasons for this may be due to fluctuations in the female endocrine environment over the reproductive cycle and/or their evolutionary history, including parental investment and the potential for maternal effects. Direct links between genome to phenome cause and effect cannot be ascertained at this stage; however, the data we report provide a vital genomic foundation on which sex-specific reproductive dysfunction and adaptation in the face of stress can be further experimentally studied, as well as novel gene targets for genetic intervention and therapy investigations.},

@article{Lang2019,
abstract = {Background The process of alternative splicing provides a unique mechanism by which eukaryotes are able to produce numerous protein products from the same gene. Heightened variability in the proteome has been thought to potentiate increased behavioral complexity and response flexibility to environmental stimuli, thus contributing to more refined traits on which natural and sexual selection can act. While it has been long known that various forms of environmental stress can negatively affect sexual behavior and reproduction, we know little of how stress can affect the alternative splicing associated with these events, and less still about how splicing may differ between sexes. Using the model of the rock dove ( Columba livia ), our team previously uncovered sexual dimorphism in the basal and stress-responsive gene transcription of a biological system necessary for facilitating sexual behavior and reproduction, the hypothlamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In this study, we delve further into understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of how changes in the environment can affect reproduction by testing the alternative splicing response of the HPG axis to an external stressor in both sexes.

Results This study reveals dramatic baseline differences in HPG alternative splicing between males and females. However, post submitting subjects to a restraint stress paradigm, we found a significant reduction in these differences between the sexes. In both stress and control treatments, we identified a higher incidence of splicing activity in the pituitary in both sexes as compared to other tissues. Of these splicing events, the core exon event is the most abundant form of splicing and more frequently occurs in the coding regions of the gene. Overall, we observed less splicing activity in the 3'UTR end of transcripts than the 5'UTR or coding regions.

Conclusions Our results provide vital new insight into sex-specific aspects of the stress response on the HPG axis at an unprecedented proximate level. Males and females uniquely respond to stress, yet exhibit splicing patterns suggesting a convergent, optimal splicing landscape for stress response. This information has the potential to inform evolutionary theory as well as the development of highly-specific drug targets for stress-induced reproductive dysfunction.},
